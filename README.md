# ML-projects

This is a personal repository summarizing the various machine learning projects I’ve worked on.

The `data` folders contain relatively large `.npz` files.

- **NASA GISS project:** The dataset is not included due to its size; it can be downloaded directly from the official online source.  
- **Navier–Stokes project:** The data provided in this repository is incomplete and only serves as an example of the datasets used to train the neural network.
